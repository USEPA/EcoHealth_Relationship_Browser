In urban ecosystems, built infrastructure typically covers a large proportion of the land surface and/or people live in high densities. These systems include all green and blue spaces within the area, such as parks, cemeteries, lakes and streams, along with human components. Urban ecosystems can serve many of the functions of natural ecosystems, to varying degrees. They are important sources of ecosystem services for human well-being due to concentrated human demand and the stresses placed on the local environment. Various green environments such as shade trees, playing fields, and urban forested wetlands, can exist within a single urban region. The services provided by urban ecosystems include filtering stormwater runoff, reducing noise, providing areas for physical activity and engagement with nature, and mitigating the Urban Heat Island effect. Additionally, urban green spaces such as planted walkways and private gardens provide opportunities for increased social interactions with neighbors.",

Drylands include a very wide variety of land cover types in four major biomes including deserts, Temperate grasslands, Mediterranean shrublands, and forests (<a href=\"https://awseastaging.epa.gov/EcoHealthBrowser/bibliography.html#UNMillennium_2005_1\" target=\"_blank\">Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005</a>). Dryland soils are very fragile and are often lost to water and wind erosion, contributing to land degradation, particulate air pollution and dust storms. However, naturally-occurring biological soil crusts and vegetative cover (e.g., trees, shrubs, grasses) can protect top soil layers against erosion and help reduce dust storms and their adverse health effects. Other services offered by drylands vegetation include air pollution filtration and improvement of water quality, temperature reduction during intense heat events, decreased water runoff, and increased aesthetic qualities.",

For instance, wetlands moderate the effects of floods by taking in and holding floodwaters and protect coastlines from storm events like hurricanes and tsunamis. Forested ecosystems have also been shown to reduce flooding and help regulate water flow in-between precipitation events by intercepting, absorbing, and slowly releasing water. In urban areas, these forests also reduce the impacts of stormwater runoff. This water regulation reduces flooding events and their negative health effects while also mitigating potential droughts through water storage. The absence of ecosystems such as wetlands and forests, which are capable of regulating water, may result in increased incidence of extreme events such as flooding, as well as exacerbate the effects of events such as hurricanes due to the lack of a proper buffer from human settlements.",

Studies show that many people prefer exercising outdoors and outdoor exercise has been shown to have more positive mental and physical health effects than indoor exercise.

With the UHI effect, metropolitan areas do not cool down at night due to the release of heat from dark surfaces that absorb heat throughout the day. In UHIs, temperatures can be 6 to 8 degrees higher in urban centers than in nearby woodlands. This fact is especially important during heat wave events, where those who reside in urban areas are often most effected due to exposure to higher maximum temperatures and less nighttime reprieve from heat. In urban systems, green spaces such as parks, urban forests and green roofs, can reduce urban temperatures and mitigate the effects of heat wave events through evapotranspiration and shading. The cooling effects of these green spaces may be especially important during heat waves, where temperatures directly outside the homes in which people are confined (elderly, infirm) have an effect on mortality.",

These ecological processes can reduce contamination of aquatic habitats, drinking-water supplies, and recreational waters. The absence of adequate natural water filtration due to habitat removal or the inability of the filtering environment to cope with the volume of pollution can lead to public-health threats from harmful chemicals and disease-causing microbes. Excessive nutrients from human activities near waterways can contribute to algal blooms, which degrade fish and wildlife habitat and sometimes also produce toxins. These threats can be reduced with water treatment systems; however, this solution is not always an option due to expense or technology limitations. One well known example of promoting natural removal of contaminants as opposed to a water treatment system is that of the Catskills watershed. Faced with building a new water filtration plant that would cost at least $6 billion to build and $300 million a year to operate, New York City opted to protect the Catskills watershed which provides their water supply. An investment of $1 to $1.5 billion to purchase and restore the watershed allowed for continued purification and filtration of the City's water resources without having to invest in upgrading the City's filtration plant.",

Pollutants of concern are often chemical mixtures, such as soot. They can be indicators as well; nitrogen dioxide is a toxic molecule that is also a marker for traffic-related mixtures.  Studies have shown that vegetation can remove, dilute, and displace air pollution. In heavily populated areas, even small air-quality improvements from trees, shrubs, \"green walls,\" etc. are estimated to reduce incidence and severity of respiratory and related illnesses, as well as reduce health-care costs and days missed from work and school. Vegetation can also increase air pollution through the production of pollen, fungal spores, and volatile organic compounds, which contribute to ozone formation.",

        "Aesthetics & Engagement With Nature": "Many people around the world enjoy recreating, relaxing, and spending time outdoors. Scientific studies show that exposure to nature is positively associated with numerous aspects of both physiological and psychological health, as well as with good social relations. Causal mechanisms for some of these associations have been demonstrated in the laboratory: faster recovery from neurological fatigue appears to be responsible for the observed effects that greenness has on mental concentration and the alleviation of ADHD symptoms in children. Exposure to natural scenery, even through a window or a photograph, slows the heart rate and calms anxiety. Humans' innate affinity for nature may be responsible for observations that people are preferentially drawn to community green space, where they are more inclined to interact with neighbors while relaxing or recreating. These interactions are directly beneficial by increasing social capital (<a href=\"https://awseastaging.epa.gov/EcoHealthBrowser/bibliography.html#Putnam_2000\" target=\"_blank\">Putnam 2000</a>), which in turn contributes positively to a variety of health and well-being issues. Access to nature, including urban green space, allows for engagement with the natural world and seems to have health benefits that extend beyond those derived from outdoor exercise. Gardens have long been components of hospital grounds and urban settings for their perceived benefits to well-being. Engagement with less cultivated outdoor environments is believed to facilitate exploration, creativity, and self-esteem in children (<a href=\"https://awseastaging.epa.gov/EcoHealthBrowser/bibliography.html#Louv_2005\" target=\"_blank\">Louv 2005</a>).

Low-income and minority populations in the U.S. are disproportionately exposed to environmental hazards, and urban areas that lack tree cover, open green spaces, and other public infrastructure.

With chronic bronchitis, the lining of the lung airways becomes irritated, thickens, and produces large amounts of mucus. With emphysema, the walls between the lung's air sacs become damaged and deflate, reducing gas exchange in the lungs. In either case, lungs cannot move much air in or out. Lung function dictates severity of COPD; it is measured using spirometry tests. How much air can be pushed out in 1 second is called forced expiratory volume in 1 second, or FEV1. How much air can be pushed out after a deep breath is taken is called forced vital capacity, or FVC. When people suffer from COPD, FEV1 and FVC numbers are lower than normal. ",
