Wetlands must have one or more of the following three attributes: (1) at least periodically, the land supports predominantly hydrophytes (aquatic plants); (2) the substrate is predominantly undrained, hydric (moist) soil; and (3) rocky, gravelly, or sandy areas are saturated with or covered by shallow water at some time during the growing season of each year (Cowardin et al., 1979). There are freshwater, saltwater, and brackish wetlands, of which there are several different types. Some common wetlands in the US include coastal salt marshes, peat bogs, lowland swamps, and even rivers and lakes (Mitsch and Gosselink, 2007). Wetlands are often rich in bird species and thus are prime bird watching areas. Wetlands also provide opportunities for other recreation activities such as fishing and hunting.",

In urban ecosystems, built infrastructure typically covers a large proportion of the land surface and/or people live in high densities. These systems include all green and blue spaces within the area, such as parks, cemeteries, lakes and streams, along with human components. Urban ecosystems can serve many of the functions of natural ecosystems, to varying degrees. They are important sources of ecosystem services for human well-being due to concentrated human demand and the stresses placed on the local environment. Various green environments such as shade trees, playing fields, and urban forested wetlands, can exist within a single urban region. The services provided by urban ecosystems include filtering water runoff, reducing noise, providing areas for physical activity and recreation, and mitigating the Urban Heat Island effect by replacing heat-absorbing impervious surfaces and increased shading from shade trees. Additionally, urban green spaces such as private gardens provide opportunities for increased social interactions with neighbors.",

Drylands are classified based on AI index and range from arid, semi-arid, and dry-subhumid lands. Drylands include a very wide variety of land cover types in four major biomes including deserts, Temperate grasslands, Mediterranean shrublands, and forests (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). Dryland soils are very fragile and are often lost to water and wind erosion, contributing to land degradation, particulate air pollution and dust storms. However, naturally-occurring biological soil crusts and vegetative cover (e.g., trees, shrubs, grasses) can protect top soil layers against erosion and help reduce dust storms and their adverse health effects. Other services offered by drylands vegetation include air pollution filtration and improvement of water quality, temperature reduction during intense heat events, decreased water runoff, and increased aesthetic qualities.",

For instance, wetlands moderate the effects of floods by taking in and holding floodwaters and protect coastlines from storm events like hurricanes and tsunamis. Forested ecosystems have also been shown to reduce flooding and help regulate water flow in-between precipitation events by intercepting, absorbing, and slowly releasing water. In urban areas, these forests also reduce the impacts of stormwater runoff. This water regulation reduces flooding events and their negative health effects while also mitigating potential droughts through water storage. The absence of ecosystems such as wetlands and forests, which are capable of regulating water, may result in increased incidence of extreme events such as flooding, as well as exacerbate the effects of events such as hurricanes due to the lack of a proper buffer from human settlements.",

With the UHI effect, metropolitan areas do not cool down at night due to the release of heat from dark surfaces that absorb heat throughout the day. In UHIs, temperatures can be 6 to 8 degrees higher in urban centers than in nearby woodlands. This fact is especially important during heat wave events, where those who reside in urban areas are often most effected due to exposure to higher maximum temperatures and less nighttime reprieve from heat. In urban systems, green spaces such as parks, urban forests and green roofs, can reduce urban temperatures and mitigate the effects of heat wave events through evapotranspiration and shading. The cooling effects of these green spaces may be especially important during heat waves, where temperatures directly outside the homes in which people are confined (elderly, infirm) have an effect on mortality.",

        "Water Quality": "When a contaminant is introduced into water, it does not always remain suspended in the water but can be taken up by plants, animals, or soil before it reaches a major water body. Ecological features, whether natural or man-made, with the appropriate plant species and soil types, can remove up to 100% of certain contaminants from various landscapes including urban and agricultural areas. This process can reduce contamination of aquatic habitats, drinking-water supplies, and recreational waters. The absence of adequate natural water filtration due to habitat removal or the inability of the filtering environment to cope with the volume of pollution can lead to significant public-health threats. These threats can be reduced with water treatment systems; however, this solution is not always an option due to expense or technology limitations. One well known example of promoting natural removal of contaminants as opposed to a water treatment system is that of the Catskills watershed. Faced with building a water filtration plant that would cost at least $6 billion to build and $300 million a year to operate, New York City opted to protect the Catskills watershed which provides their water supply. An investment of $1 to $1.5 billion to purchase and restore the watershed allowed for continued purification and filtration of the City&#39;s water resources without having to invest in a filtration plant.",

Due to their significant negative health effects, their natural removal, dilution, or displacement can protect public health. In heavily populated areas, even small air-quality improvements from tree cover are estimated to significantly reduce incidence and severity of respiratory and related illnesses, as well as reduce health-care costs and days missed from work and school.

        "Aesthetics & Engagement With Nature": "Many people around the world enjoy recreating, relaxing, and spending time outdoors. Scientific studies show that exposure to nature is positively associated with numerous aspects of both physiological and psychological health, as well as with good social relations. Causal mechanisms for some of these associations have been demonstrated in the laboratory: faster recovery from neurological fatigue appears to be responsible for the observed effects that greenness has on mental concentration and the alleviation of ADHD symptoms in children. Exposure to natural scenery, even through a window or a photograph, slows the heart rate and calms anxiety. Humans' innate affinity for nature may be responsible for observations that people are preferentially drawn to community green space, where they are more inclined to interact with neighbors while relaxing or recreating. These interactions are directly beneficial by increasing social capital (Putnam 2000), which in turn contributes positively to a variety of health and well-being issues. Access to nature, including urban green space, allows for engagement with the natural world and seems to have health benefits that extend beyond those derived from outdoor exercise. Gardens have long been components of hospital grounds and urban settings for their perceived benefits to well-being. Engagement with less cultivated outdoor environments is believed to facilitate exploration, creativity, and self-esteem in children (Louv 2005). The notion that humans, as natural creatures that evolved within ecological settings, have an innate affinity for nature has been dubbed biophilia (Wilson 1984). This concept is one explanation for observed improvements in many aspects of human health with increased exposure to features, even representations, of the natural world.",

Low-income and minority populations in the U.S. are disproportionately exposed to environmental hazards, and urban areas that lack tree cover, open green spaces, and other public infrastructure. Inequitable distribution of public assets weakens public health and community resilience to stress. Ecosystem services can reduce environmental and health inequities by improving air and water quality, mitigating heat and flood events, and providing space for recreation and mental well-being.

With emphysema, the walls between the lung's air sacs become damaged and deflate, reducing gas exchange in the lungs. In either case, lungs cannot move much air in or out. Lung function dictates severity of COPD; it is measured using spirometry tests. How much air can be pushed out in 1 second is called forced expiratory volume in 1 second, or FEV1.

        "Urban Ecosystems | Water Hazard Mitigation": "Green spaces such as gardens, urban forests and planted medians can have significant effects on urban hydrologic processes. Because urban areas have high levels of impervious surfaces such as roads and parking lots, urban green spaces are essential to reducing the effects these surfaces can have on water absorption and flow. Urban forests and street trees have been shown to reduce stormwater runoff through interception and absorption of water (<a href='https://leb.epa.gov/enviroatlas/natlas/currentdevelopment/Tools/EcoHealth_RelationshipBrowser/bibliography.html#McPhersonG_2005' target='_blank'>McPherson et al., 2005</a>; <a href='https://leb.epa.gov/enviroatlas/natlas/currentdevelopment/Tools/EcoHealth_RelationshipBrowser/bibliography.html#Sanders_1986' target='_blank'>Sanders 1986</a>). Forest cover is also inversely correlated with water yield; thus, more forest cover reduces water yield and helps modulate stream flow after rain events such that there is not high, rapid peak flow followed by low base flow (<a href='https://leb.epa.gov/enviroatlas/natlas/currentdevelopment/Tools/EcoHealth_RelationshipBrowser/bibliography.html#Hibbert_1967' target='_blank'>Hibbert 1967</a>, <a href='https://leb.epa.gov/enviroatlas/natlas/currentdevelopment/Tools/EcoHealth_RelationshipBrowser/bibliography.html#Baker_2004' target='_blank'>Baker et al., 2004</a>). In vegetated areas, only 5-15% of rainwater runs off the ground whereas in areas with no vegetation, 60% of water may run off into storm drains (<a href='https://leb.epa.gov/enviroatlas/natlas/currentdevelopment/Tools/EcoHealth_RelationshipBrowser/bibliography.html#Bolund_1999' target='_blank'>Bolund and Hunhammar 1999</a>). Conifer species have the highest minimum and maximum surface water storage capacities. For coniferous, broadleaf evergreen, and broadleaf deciduous species tested, the mean storage capacities are 1.25 mm (SD 0.38), 0.78 mm (SD 0.05), and 0.77 mm (SD 0.19), respectively (<a href='https://leb.epa.gov/enviroatlas/natlas/currentdevelopment/Tools/EcoHealth_RelationshipBrowser/bibliography.html#XiaoB_2015' target='_blank'>Xiao and McPherson, 2015</a>). Additionally, constructed spaces such as green roofs and rain gardens can aid in stormwater management in urban areas. Green roofs help prevent runoff and retain rainwater which eventually evaporates or is transpired back into the atmosphere. One study estimated that if 20% of buildings in Washington, DC, had green roofs, they could store approximately 253 million gallons of rainwater in an average year (Deutsch et al., 2005). Green roofs in dryland urban environments can also reduce the impacts of stormwater runoff; rooftops consisting of succulent, shrub, and herbaceous plant species reduced water runoff by more than 80-90% compared to bare rooftops (<a href='https://leb.epa.gov/enviroatlas/natlas/currentdevelopment/Tools/EcoHealth_RelationshipBrowser/bibliography.html#Nardini_2012' target='_blank'>Nardini et al., 2012</a>; <a href='https://leb.epa.gov/enviroatlas/natlas/currentdevelopment/Tools/EcoHealth_RelationshipBrowser/bibliography.html#Volder_2014' target='_blank'>Volder and Dvorak, 2014</a>).
